### What is a version control or source code management system, and why do you need it?
Version or source control is an integral part of the software development process.
Version control is critical in instance where locally hosted code may be lost or a
definitive history of code changes is needed. Version control is also critical for many
collaborative aspects of coding including the review of pull request and the
management of conflicts.
  Version deals with overlaying or conflicting code by creating what is called a merge
conflict. There are many ways of dealing with merge conflicts, but ultimately there’s
it dependent on the developers knowhow to resolve the changes in a way that
preserves the functionality of both. It’s important for developers to be well
coordinated in order to prevent merge conflicts.
  Commits are simply saved changes that are made to the codebase or directory
structure of a repo. Once changes are committed they are then “pushed” to a branch
which can then can be merged with the larger project using a “pull request” or simply
pushed into the master branch.
  A repository is an organizing unit of code usually comprising a single project or
application. Git and other version control frameworks use public repositories to allow
general users to view and edit code as part of an open-source project. Private
repositories on the other hand only allow designated users to participate.
